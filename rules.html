		<h1>Standards Of Conduct</h1>

		<h2 id="network-access">Network Access</h2>

		<p>Usage of this network is a privilege, not a right. Your access can be
		revoked at any time for any reason. The reason doesn't have to make sense to
		you and it doesn't have to be fair. General policies, however, are listed
		below.</p>

		<h2 id="security-and-liability">Security And Liability</h2>

		<p>matrix.saturn.gay attempts to run a safe and secure network. However, the security
		bots cannot catch everyone with ill intent and we cannot guarantee the security
		of a user's matrix client. We will respond with haste to any reported
		security related incident. That said, <b>matrix.saturn.gay is not responsible or
		liable for the security or lack thereof surrounding your time on the
		network.</b></p>

		<p>We have never received any requests for user information and would
		probably wet ourselves laughing if we did.</p>

		<h2 id="bot-policy">Bot Policy</h2>

		<p>matrix.saturn.gay tolerates all bot software with 2 major exceptions. The
		bots cannot: 1) disrupt the network. 2) disrupt server activity. It is
		up to the discretion of the staff and server admins to determine what
		constitutes "disruption". If you are asked to remove your bot from the
		network, it is expected you will act promptly with minimal fuss.
		Failure to do so may cause a revocation of your access to the network.

		<h2 id="personal-conduct">Personal Conduct</h2>

		<h3 id="network-policies">Network Policies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Do</b>: obey the network staff. See below for more.</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: violate any law in your country.</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: evade bans or ignores.</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: threaten another user or users with physical or
			network violence (including DDoS)</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: attempt to host a botnet here.</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>We absolutely will not tolerate child pornography or any content
			that endangers minors.</b></li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will engage local authorities as necessary to deal with illegal
		content and activities. Yes, we have done this before.</p>

		<h3 id="community-policies">Community Policies</h3>

		<p><a href="reasonable_person.html">Reasonable person principle</a> applies.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Everyone will be reasonable.</li>
			<li>Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.</li>
			<li>No one is special.</li>
			<li>Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additionally, please take note of the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
			<li>Alert the staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone
			in distress.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning
		conduct are among the types of unreasonable behaviors deemed to be unacceptable.</p>

		<p>Harassing behavior includes, but is not limited to: offensive comments
		related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
		inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; deliberate
		intimidation, stalking or following; sustained disruption of server
		activity; unwelcome sexual attention; ignore and/or ban evasion.</p>

		<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
		immediately.</p>

		<p>If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the server admins may take any
		action they deem appropriate within the bounds of the
		<a href="governance.html">governance policies</a>. Initial violations or violations
		believed be unintentional, if not repeated, will likely only result in warnings.
		Repeated violations or intentional harassment will be met with increasingly
		severe responses.</p>


		<h3 id="server-specific-policies">Server Specific Policies</h3>

		<p>Where they do not collide with network policy, individual servers
		can set their own standard of conduct. These policies must be made
		visible in such a way that new users  are made immediately aware of
		them when they join the server. We suggest using the server
		homepage.</p>

		<h3 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h3>

		<p>If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else
		is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
		please notify the Network admins by reporting the message in question.
		Consult the <a href="governance.html">governance policies</a> as to the
		proper process.</p>

		<p>A full staff listing is available on <a href="staff.html">the staff
		page</a>.</p>
